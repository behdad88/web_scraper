You will also play a critical role in the expansion and evolution of the Data Science team; from helping with recruiting top-tier talent to training, coaching and up-skilling other members of the Technology team.

What you’ll bring to Attest

A strong understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of statistics and modern machine learning techniques.

Excellent interpersonal skills and the ability to clearly communicate your ideas to peers as well as the wider business.

We’ve got passionate people in all our teams, and we’ve got so much more we want to achieve. We’re for ever, for everyone and we really mean that. We don’t want to stop at 5.5 million members and we want everyone to feel welcome and enjoy access to our places, so we need to reach new audiences in ways that are meaningful and relevant to them without losing the hearts and minds of those that are already with us.

Above all you’ll be curious – wanting to learn more about our audiences – and confident in exploring all of our data to pull out the truly actionable insight.

Who is the local audience for a property, and where are the opportunities to grow?

What are the key drivers for people visiting a particular place?

Who eats in our cafes, and where would potential growth come from?

Are people who visit our properties more likely to renew their membership? Is this different across audiences?

Who we're looking for

You’ll be a self-starter with a real passion for using data and analytics to understand, explain and predict business performance

So, we are always looking for graduates or working practitioners in any technical discipline with an aptitude for analysing betting markets or for writing software to bet into those markets. Our very best people combine those skills with the capacity to see projects through from start to finish, and much else besides.

These betting solutions entail the development of mathematical/statistical models and high-performance algorithms; efficient coding; automation of betting operations; data generation, acquisition, storage and manipulation; performance analysis through back-testing and simulations. We use a variety of programming languages and we believe in using the right tool for the right job. The team is comprised of PhD level scientists.

Ravelin Technology,Data Scientist,"Ravelin is pioneering the use of machine learning in the prevention of e-commerce fraud and has been very successful in the four years we have been in operation. Companies all over the world are accepting more transactions with fewer chargebacks thanks to our machine learning-based approach to fraud prevention.

YOUR TEAM

You will be joining to lead the Detection team. The Detection team is responsible for keeping fraud rates low – and clients happy – by continuously training and deploying machine learning models. We aim to make model deployments as easy and error free as code deployments. Google’s Best Practices for ML Engineering is our bible.

Our models are trained to spot multiple types of fraud, using a variety of data sources and techniques in real time. The prediction pipelines are under strict SLAs, every prediction must be returned in under 300ms. When models are not performing as expected, it’s down to the Detection team to investigate why.

The Detection team is core to Ravelin’s success. They work closely with the Data Engineering Team who build infrastructure and the Intelligence & Investigations Team who liaise with clients.



Ravelin is looking for a Data Scientist to help train, deploy, debug and evaluate our fraud detection models. Our ideal candidate is pragmatic, approachable and filled with knowledge tempered by past failures.

Evaluating fraud models is hard; often times we do not even get labels for 3 months. You’ll need to use your judgement when investigating cases of ambiguous fraud and when you’re investigating the veracity of the model itself.

We have to build robust models that are capable of updating their beliefs when they encounter new methods of fraud our clients expect us to be one step ahead of fraud, not behind. You will be given the equipment, space and guidance you need to build world class fraud detection models.

The work is not all green field research. The everyday work is about making safe incremental progress towards better models for our clients. The ideal candidate is willing to get involved in both aspects of the job – and understand why both are important.

m/SIX,Data Analyst,"Description

m/SIX is the UK's fastest-growing media planning and buying agency, having doubled in size in the last eighteen months to 150 people and £200m in billings. Our international network now comprises over 40 offices across 3 continents.

We have a unique proposition and ownership structure, which is fundamental to how we operate for our clients. We are majority owned by our partners within The&Partnership, but GroupM’s minority ownership means that we are able to offer a true ‘best of both worlds’ advantage. This means a progressive and entrepreneurial approach to business and culture, whilst providing full access to GroupM’s market leading pricing, data and technology assets. The&Partnership overall has a strong ethic of pitching in and getting our hands dirty, regardless of level. As such we are naturally less hierarchical and territorial than many other agency environments, particularly when it comes to working with creative teams.

As both The&Partnership and m/SIX we have therefore created new models and ways of working, which are leading the industry in defining the agency of the future. This means solutions built bespoke for clients’ individual needs, inclusive of all necessary disciplines and working to one bottom line. Creatives, strategist, analysts, investment and production teams working together, with data and technology at the centre. These teams are often implanted directly within the client marketing teams: in the UK we have fully embedded teams at News UK, Talk Talk and Toyota/Lexus. The impact of this has been transformational on our clients’ business.

The agency is designed to think audience first – to face into disruption. We use data signals to understand the flow of audiences and build communications systems that balance the need to build and convert demand. We turn real behavioural data into actionable human insight that informs all communications at both strategic & implementational levels. This means that we’re geared toward business growth, not just media growth. Our aim is always to become a valued board-level business partner of the clients we work with.

As a direct outcome of this progressive & transformational agenda, m/SIX has two ambitions. To be a top ten agency in every market in which we operate, and to be the most important place in the careers of our people.

Who is the client?
TalkTalk are the UK’s value champion in Broadband and combined TV, Mobile and Internet services. Unlike Sky, BT and Virgin with their flashy celebrity led campaigns, TalkTalk genuinely put ‘the customer’ at the heart of their business. This is reflected in our campaigns which feature a real ‘TalkTalk family’ – showcasing ‘real people/ real lives’.

We help TalkTalk invest over £70m annually in media across all brand and performance channels. With an integrated team, rich in data and analytics and working closely within an embedded team together with our creative agency The&Partnership.

What is the role?

TalkTalk is a data-driven business and produces significant amounts of data from its marketing activities. Equally m/SIX produces a large amount of data in the design and implementation of media activity across all online and offline channels. In order to be able to report and optimise media performance we need to identify, source, structure and quality control the right data to inform both online and offline media planning. This role therefore involves being the ‘champion’ of data collection, analysis, interpretation and reporting design on the TalkTalk media account. We have a specialist analytics team at m/SIX which undertakes econometric modelling and other data analytics work and this role includes helping this team obtain the data they need to deliver their analytical outputs.

Key Responsibilities



Who are you?

How will success of this role be measured?

Where is the role based?

As TalkTalk move their operations up to the North-West we are very excited to be moving alongside them. This role will be co-located in the client’s new headquarters Soapworks, a multifaceted destination hub on Greater Manchester’s Waterfront. Working in such proximity with the client will enable us to work in smarter, more nimble ways to deliver the most innovative data-driven work. We envision that this move to the north-west will just be the start for m/SIX making their mark on the Manchester market and we are therefore looking for someone who can also help us grow our northern footprint.

GroupM is an equal opportunity employer. We view everyone as an individual and we understand that inclusion is more than just diversity – it’s about belonging. We celebrate the fact that everyone is unique and that’s what makes us so good at what we do. We pride ourselves on being a company that embraces difference and truly represents the global clients we work with.

Signal International,Data Scientist,"Job DescriptionDescription About Signal: Signal has created a platform for analysing text and discovering market intelligence. Our large-scale text analytics system (currently processing more than 3 million documents a day in real-time) unlocks knowledge and insights from unstructured textual data using diverse text analytics and machine learning (ML) components. To do this, we face multiple challenges. For instance, we need near de-duplication in real-time to group similar articles from different publications, or entity disambiguation so that we can identify if, for example, a mention of ""apple"" refers to the fruit or the tech company. Our media monitoring product, built on top of our technology, is enabling organisations to solve real-time complex information challenges (e.g. ""All the news related to IPOs of European technology companies""). We Signallers are friendly and informal people! We don't let formality get in the way of pushing our product, we all have a stake in our success. We have an inclusive environment welcoming the skills and experiences from diverse backgrounds. Together we have created who we are and what we sell. We are proud of our achievements and continue to strive for the unknown. We are a venture-backed company, having secured 12m in its Series B funding round from investors such as GMG Ventures, MMC Ventures, Frontline Ventures, and Reed Elsevier. What will you be doing: Here at Signal all data scientists share one function, which allows us to exchange research questions and experiences through our regular research guild meetings and research seminars. Broadly though, we see a continuum between two profiles: the Research Scientist and the Data Scientist (this role here). While the Research Scientist mostly works on longer-term research projects and has deep expertise on Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Information Retrieval (IR), usually to a PhD/Postdoc level or equivalent professional experience, the Data Scientist is mostly involved in shorter iterations of innovation. While there are different requirements specified below, depending on your interest, you can move along this continuum. As Data Scientist, you will be a core player in the growth of our platform and of the products built on top of it. You will be driving the product's strategy and the roadmap by amplifying the impact that ML and NLP techniques have on the direction of the product. You will work within one of our product teams to innovate , collaborate , and iterate in developing solutions to difficult problems. Our teams are autonomous and cross functional, encompassing every role required to build and improve on our products in the way we best see fit (e.g. UX / UI Designers, engineers, and data scientists). You will help the team discover client problems, explore the feasibility and value of solutions by building proof-of-concepts and prototypes and by conducting offline and online experiments. You will collaborate with other team members on bringing further iterations into the product.

Deliveroo,"Data Scientist, Economist","Job Title: Data Scientist, Economist

Location: Cannon Street, London

Salary: Competitive

Closing Date: 30th October 2019



When you first think about Deliveroo, you probably think of getting great food to your house in less than half an hour. Awesome, right? But behind the scenes is the real story. This story is one of high growth, huge challenges, and an enormous opportunity ahead of us. It began with our founder Will, arriving in London over 5 years ago and finding it almost impossible to order great food, despite the wealth of incredible restaurants in the city. Fast forward 5 years and we operate in 13 countries with over 50,000 riders who deliver orders from 50,000 restaurants in over 200 cities worldwide.

We want to be the definitive food company - the app you go to any time you have a hunger pang. We are transforming the way people think about food. We are providing people with limitless access to different cuisines and restaurants, turning cooking from a chore to a choice, and giving people the freedom to eat what they want, when they want, where they want it.

We work with riders, restaurants and consumers. We operate one of the most complex three-sided marketplaces in the world and we do this in real time. Millions of customers and thousands of restaurants and riders rely on us to match them within milliseconds. The algorithms behind that marketplace are the secret sauce that allow us to deliver our orders in under 30 minutes.



The scale of the opportunity ahead of us is immense. The global food market is valued at £7.7 trillion but only 1% of it is currently online. Contrast that with the digital disruption of countless other industries - from banking and travel to retail and communications - it's clear that our journey in the food sector has only just begun.

We are already a multi-billion dollar company that is more than doubling in size every year. Deliveroo came top in the FT's' list of Europe's fastest growing 1000 companies in 2018, and we were the first company ever to win Deloitte's 'UK Top 50' two years in a row. Yet most of the extraordinary value this company will generate lies ahead of us.



As an Economist at Deliveroo you will help scale our business and improve the experience for restaurants, riders, and eaters.

The work you will do will have direct, measurable impact on the bottom line.







We believe a great workplace is one that represents the world we live in and how beautifully diverse it can be. That means we have no judgement when it comes to any one of the things that make you who you are - your gender, race, sexuality, religion or a secret aversion to coriander. All you need is a passion for (most) food and a desire to be part of one of the fastest growing start ups around.",Full-time,"Restaurants,Food & Beverages,Human Resources",nan,Restaurants,Entry level,nan,nan,https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search/?keywords=data%20scientist&location=United%20Kingdom&start=675
